Basic Java
===========

Writing in Java is easy once you get the hang of the basic ideas it is written on.
Java is designed from the ground up to be reliant on 'Object Oriented Programming',
a form of *top down desing* that uses different objects to come together to run basic programs

This section of the cheat sheet will explian basic java and provide code snippets of how they may be used.

For having the robot choose between different things or follow not pre-defined instructions, use if-statements
For condensing code down so you don't have to write the same instruction several times, use functions
For having the robot repeat commands, use loops
To use math in code to write algorithms, look at the math section
For making decisions with many different choices, use switch-statements
To ask another 'object' to do something, look at calling methods
