programming cheat sheet
======================

These resources are intended to be used while actually programming. 
Most tasks should be able to be completed only referencing these resources.

.. note::
    I will not go into detail about why or how most of these things work, 
    I will just give surface level notes or context. 
    For a deeper understanding of how all of things work, reference the rest of the documentation!
